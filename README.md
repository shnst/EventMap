Every time when you go on to event finder like EventBrite , all you usually see is either famous concerts happening or some 

major parade or rave coming up. There isn't really visibility for small events such as like info sessions, club meeting or 

charity events. They are usually overshadowed by the big events happening around them and EventBrite tends to feature more of 

those events. 

Event Map will allow user to check out near by events happening around them. 

This application is mainly targeted towards people such as students, family and organizations. 

For example, if you want to create a welcoming party for campus students, one can easily ulitize this applications to create 

an event. Another case where if you are a throwing a charity events for a good cause and you can create an event. 

This application is not meant to be a mainstream event finder such as EventBrite. It is mainly for local communities.
